This research delves into the comprehensive analysis of Roche Holding AG's stock price dynamics on the SIX Swiss Exchange over a 7040-day period from April 1995 to December 2022. Utilizing Bloomberg data, the study investigates various stylized facts concerning the non-stationarity of prices, the stationarity of returns, skewness, kurtosis, autocorrelation, volatility clustering, and leverage effect. Through rigorous statistical tests such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, Jarque-Bera test, and Ljung-Box test, the research provides empirical evidence supporting each stylized fact. Notably, the findings reveal a persistent upward trend in prices but non-stationarity, while returns demonstrate stationarity. Moreover, the presence of negative skewness, fat tails, volatility clustering, and the leverage effect in returns are observed, implying asymmetry and clustering of large price changes. The study further employs ARMA and GARCH models to capture the autocorrelation and conditional heteroskedasticity in the data. The analysis contributes to a deeper understanding of the underlying dynamics of Roche Holding's stock prices, offering valuable insights for investors, policymakers, and financial analysts.
